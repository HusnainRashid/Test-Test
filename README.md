# Test-Test
Setting up RSpec
# This assumes you have Ruby & RVM installed. If you don't, visit:
# https://rvm.io/ to install RVM.

# First, create a directory for your project
; mkdir your-project-directory
; cd your-project-directory

# Then, we're going to get you the latest Ruby
; rvm get stable
; rvm use ruby --latest --install --default

# Next, install bundler, which manages dependencies like RSpec
; gem install bundler

# Create a bundler project
; bundle init

# And add RSpec to your dependencies
; bundle add rspec

# Generate an RSpec template
; rspec --init

# Create a folder for your implementation code
; mkdir lib

# And create a repository for your changes
; git init .
; git add .
; git commit -m "Project setup"

# Then go and create a repository on github.com
# On the next screen after you have created the repository,
# follow the "Push an existing repository from the command line" section
# To push your project to your github repository
# It will look something like this...
; git remote add origin YOUR_REMOTE_ADDRESS
; git branch -M main
; git push -u origin main

This code has been structured in a very basic way, with being able to access through the terminal. There are 2 files, one with direct user interaction and
another with the interaction through the code.
The test can be run simply using rspec and the rest of the code can be run through the methods
